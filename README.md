# -Using-JavaScript-and-Deploying-a-Website

This code combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive website for Raj's Robot Rentals:
HTML: The HTML file (index.html) sets up the structure of the webpage. It includes elements for the header, main content, and footer. It also includes placeholders for displaying information about robot models, duration, and calculated cost. Two buttons are provided for switching between robot models and changing the rental duration.
CSS: The CSS file (styles.css) contains styling rules to visually enhance the webpage. It ensures that elements are properly positioned, styled, and visually appealing. The use of CSS helps to create a cohesive design for the website.
JavaScript: The JavaScript file (scripts.js) adds interactivity to the website. It defines variables to hold information about the selected robot model and rental duration. It includes functions to recalculate the total cost based on the selected model and duration, and to update the displayed model name and duration when users interact with the corresponding buttons.
Overall, this code provides the foundation for a user-friendly website where visitors can easily explore different robot models, adjust rental durations, and see the updated cost in real time.
